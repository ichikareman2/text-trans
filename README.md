## END

This project was created to be my text transformer app for when I want to type in a superscript text or other transformations.

I found out that the javascript functions i've been using was wrong as I could not copy and paste the text together with the transformation as it is still just html (I intended to use it in chat).

I've made changes which converts texts to ascii equivalent superscript, but then found out that the letter q does not have a matching superscript and some other characters doesn't exist either.

The changes would have been my last update as it is still usable for words without q but then my laptop broke and I couldn't push those changes. The feeling of incompleteness left me unmotivated to continue this

In conclusion or final decision whatever, I will leave this be to serve as my reference for the way I used electron ipc.

# text-trans

Electron app for transforming text to superscript. Made for learning purposes only.

## Future
